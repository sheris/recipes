1 c popcorn
2 T coconut oil
salt to taste

Heat the oil on medium heat until glistening. Drop a couple of kernels
into the oil and let sit until they pop. Pour the remaining popcorn into the
oil and put the lid on the pot. Leave a crack between the lid and the pot to 
allow steam to escape.

Listen for the first few kernels to pop. When it seems like you're getting some 
popping momentum, start vigorously shaking the pan across the burner.
This will prevent the popcorn from burning. 

When the popping starts to subside and there is only one or two pops every 
few seconds, you're done. It is normal for there to be several (to many) unpopped
kernals at the bottom of the pot.

Salt and season however you like.
